  This week's progress consisted mostly of finishing up my literature review and starting to take a deeper look at my data and assess what steps will need to be taken to clean it up before I begin my analysis. The articles that I found this week did not end up providing me with any new or different information as the previous week, but it did help me to narrow down my focus. Due to the large size of my data, I have decided to focus only on ultramarathons that have taken place in the US, and will only be looking at athletes from the US as well. While this will help to narrow down the scope of my project and size of my data, it will also help to reduce bias in my results due to underrepresentation of certain ethnicities. During my literature review, I was surprised to learn that the lack of African athletes in ultramarathon races can be attributed to the lack of monetary incentive to compete in and win such races. 
  Scanning through my data, I also noticed a couple entries for athletes lacking age information. I have decided to remove all entries with incomplete data as the dataset is still big enough that there should be very little impact on conclusions drawn from analyses. The last issue that I have run into that will still take some brainstorming is the measurment of event distances. My dataset contains races measured in times and distance. As of right now, to deal with this I think I will only focus on races measured in distance, but I plan on taking the week to determine what the best course of action is. All in all, I have not run into any major issues this week, just small wrinkles that should be ironed out in the next week or so!
