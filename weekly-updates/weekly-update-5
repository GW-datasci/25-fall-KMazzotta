This week ended up getting unexpectedly busy for me, so it was a bit of a slower week progress-wise, but I was still able to take some steps forward in my project!
I worked on narrowing down the date range for my project in an effort to make the dataset a little smaller and more manageble. I also think that using more recent dates will be more accurate when it comes to the predictive modeling stage as the data will hopefully reflect the incorperation of new technologies/gear in the ultra running world.
I also decided to do a little bit more literature reviewing, however, while very interesting, the articles I read helped to provide me with some more background information, but nothing directly relevant to my project.
My steps this week will be to create a couple more graphs and charts to finish up the exploratory data analysis step and hopefully start working on some predictive modeling!
