This week I worked on splitting up my dataset by race distance to make analysis easier. I decided to only use data from races measured in distance rather than time as races measured in time (like 24hr+ and max distance) would be too variable to use for predictive purposes.
After splitting up my data by race distance, I also chose to only include races with 200+ participants. While at first this was a random number I chose to exclude some of the smaller races (as bigger races are usually more standardized),I was advised to come up with a more scientific reasoning behind this rule, and thus looked at the average number of participants for each distance and actually concluded that that number was a little under 200, therefore I will be sticking with using races with 200+ participants.
Now that these samples/datasets have been established, I am planning on starting some predictive modeling, specifically using linear regresion and perhaps comparing regression models across race distances.
